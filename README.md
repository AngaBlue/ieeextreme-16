## Using Input Files
You can feed your input from a file (and have it be treated as `stdin`), then have `stdout` redirect to `out.txt` using the following command.

```
type ascii-dancer.txt | node ascii-dancer.js > out.txt
```

For Python programs, its very similar.

```
type pizza-cutter.txt | py pizza-cutter.py > out.txt
```
